					<h3>Appearance</h3>
					<p>
						In the winter of 1891, the students of the College of the Youth Christian Association from Springfield, Massachusetts, who were forced to perform gymnastic exercises, considered at that time the only means of introducing young people to sports, were very bored in physical education classes. The monotony of such activities had to be put to an end.
College lecturer James Naismith found a way out of this situation. On December 21, 1891, he tied two peach baskets to the balcony railing of the sports hall and, dividing eighteen students into two teams, offered them a game, the meaning of which was to throw more balls into the opponents' basket.

The idea of this game originated in his school years, when children played the old game "duck-on-a-rock" ("Duck on a rock"). The meaning of this popular game at that time was as follows: throwing a small stone, it was necessary to hit the top of another stone, larger in size.

The game, dubbed "basketball", only vaguely resembled a modern sport. There was no running the ball, the players only threw it to each other, standing still, and then tried to throw it into the basket, and exclusively with both hands from below or from the chest, and after a successful throw, one of the players climbed onto a ladder attached to the wall and extracted the ball from the basket. Dr. Naismith's goal was to create a collective game in which a large number of participants could be involved at the same time, and his invention fully met this task.

In 1892, Senda Berenson, a physical education teacher at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, developed the first rules for women's basketball.

					<h3>Becoming</h3>
					<p>
						The first stages of the development of basketball are associated with its spread in US educational institutions — schools and colleges. Even before the beginning of the XX century, the game quickly gained some popularity not only in the United States, but also in Canada. The founder of basketball, the college of the Youth Christian Association, was initially actively involved in regulating and distributing the game, but a decade later the management came to the conclusion that this activity hindered the implementation of the main mission of the educational institution, and decided to distance itself from the new sport. In 1898, the first attempt was made to create a professional association — the National Basketball League — but it lasted only five years. After World War I, two amateur organizations assumed responsibility for the rules and guidelines: the National Association of Student Sports and the Amateur Sports Union. An active role in the popularization of basketball was played at that time by its immediate creator, J. Naismith.

In Russia, basketball began to be played in 1906 in the St. Petersburg society "Mayak", also known as the "Committee for the Promotion of Moral and Mental Development of Young People" [2]. In 1909, it hosted the first tournament with the participation of 6 teams. In 1913, the rules of the game were published. Since 1923, the USSR basketball championships have been held, where the first champion was Dynamo Moscow (men's) and Dynamo Moscow (women's).
